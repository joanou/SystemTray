SystemTray
==========

Cross-platform SystemTray and AppIndicator support for java applications.

This libraries only purpose is to show *reasonably* decent system-tray icons and app-indicators with a simple popup-menu.

There are a number of problems on Linux with the Swing (and SWT) system-tray icons, namely that
1. Swing system-tray icons on linux **do not** support transparent backgrounds (they have a white background)
2. Swing/SWT **do not** support app-indicators, which are necessary on more recent versions of linux (ie: ubuntu)
3. Swing popup menus look like crap
  - system-tray icons use a JMenuPopup, which looks nicer than the java 'regular' one.
  - app-indicators use native popups.


This is for cross-platform use, specifically - linux 32/64, mac 32/64, and windows 32/64. Java 6+
This library uses JNA, which means there are fun bits that are native.


```
Note: This library does NOT uses SWT for system-tray support, only for the purpose
      of lessening the jar dependencies. SWT-based wouldn't be difficult, just remember
      that SWT on linux *already* starts up the GTK main event loop.

      This library might need some additional testing in SWT environments.
```
```
Note: If you use the attached JNA libraries, you **MUST** load the respective
      native libraries yourself, especially with JNA (as the loading logic has
      been removed from the jar)
```
```
Note: This project was heavily influence by the excellent Lantern project,
      *Many* thanks to them for figuring out AppIndicators via JNA.
